# BioInspiredAIDrone - James' part


Drone.py and Physics.py contain the classes and stuff that make the drone and the sim work. You need to download these too, but as long as they're just in the same file as Display_Drone.py it will work.

Currently it's just a physics sim; Display_Drone will open a pygame window with a white ball, which falls under gravity. You can press the up arrow to make it move up, having the same effect as a drone's propellors would.

Currently to run the code with NEAT you will need to install the package 'neat-python'. This contains all of the functions relating to the NEAT genetic algorithm. You will also need to install pygame. 

Running the code is very simple as you only need to run the main.py function. I have list a few variables that you can change to see how the code would run differently. You can also change things in the config-feedforward.txt file but something's are very important not to change so be careful with these.
