# BioInspiredAIDrone

Drone.py and Physics.py contain the classes and stuff that make the drone and the sim work. You need to download these too, but as long as they're just in the same file as Display_Drone.py it will work.

Currently it's just a physics sim; Display_Drone will open a pygame window with a white ball, which falls under gravity. You can press the up arrow to make it move up, having the same effect as a drone's propellors would.
